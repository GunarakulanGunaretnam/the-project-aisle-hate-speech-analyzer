### Introduction

As humans we often forget to advocate for social problems that create disparities, hate speech, and misinformation until the pathway for solution opens. Instead we jump into other problems which are very natural, and proven in the past incidents that happened in Sri Lanka. There are many reasons such as security, commitments, and betrayals etc. which are acceptable as humans but leaving the problem as it is very dangerous too.

Hence, artificial intelligence is being used to benefit for peacebuilding, ensuring the security of human beings, sustainable development, and to voice for the voiceless.
